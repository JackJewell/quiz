quiz
This program runs a quiz that asks questions about basic javascript.
It runs a timer alongside the quiz that give you a score based on how quickly you answer questions.
If I had been able to complete the assignment properly it then would have displayed your high score on a board, 
but unfortunately I couldn't figure this out before the deadline.
